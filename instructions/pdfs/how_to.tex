\section{Algorithm's metadata}
In order to write algorithms, user needs to specify 
metadata that describes the algorithm. It is important
to make the metadata clear, because it affects the 
process of algorithm's visualisation. All of the
meta data described in the following subsections
should be added using script in /instructions folder,
however there is no issue with adding metadata manually,
if it's made correctly.

\subsection{Steps}
The file that represents steps displayed on page
is step algorithms.
